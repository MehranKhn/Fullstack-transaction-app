Transaction App

This is a full-stack web application designed to simulate a transaction platform, featuring secure user authentication, atomic operations, and a user directory with search functionality. Users can sign up, sign in, view dummy account balances, and discover other users on the platform.

‚ú® Features
User Authentication:

Sign Up: New users can create an account.

Sign In: Registered users can securely log in.

JWT Authentication: Secure token-based authentication for protecting routes and user data.

Atomicity: Ensures that all transactions are processed reliably, either completing entirely or failing completely, maintaining data integrity.

User Directory & Search:

Logged-in users can view a list of other registered users.

Powerful search functionality to find desired users quickly.

Dummy Account Amounts: Users can view a simulated amount in their account, providing a basic representation of funds.

Responsive Design: (Assuming this is true, common for modern web apps) The application is designed to be accessible and user-friendly across various devices and screen sizes.
